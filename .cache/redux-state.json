They hash the block header. It is 80 bytes of data that will ultimately be hashed.\n\nThe header contains this info:\n\n| Name \t       |Byte Size| \tDescription                                         |\n|--------------|---------|------------------------------------------------------|\n|Version \t   |  4 \t |Block version number                                  |\n|Previous Hash | 32 \t |This is the previous block header                     |\n|Merkle Root   | 32 \t |The hash based on all of the transactions in the block|\n|Time \t       | 4 \t     |Current time stamp as seconds (unix format)           |\n|Bits \t       | 4 \t     |Target value in compact form                          |\n|Nonce         | 4 \t     |User adjusted value starting from 0                   |\n\n![genesis](genesis.png)\n<p align='center'>A snap of the latest block at Bitcoin blockchain at the time of writing.</a></p>\n\n## How would the consensus deem a mined block as accepted?\nSee the **Bits** part ?

It is the MAXIMUM value acceptable by the consensus for the hash.\n\n### MAXIMUM value?\nI thought you’d never ask! See the **nonce** part in the block header? Yup, miners need to start all the way from 0 (some may try to skip values, completely up to miner) to the number that when used in the block header, yields a hash sum below the target.

The process of finding blocks is now so crowded and the difficulty of finding a block so high that it would take over an year to generate any coins on an average high-end gaming system. While you could simply set a machine aside and have it run the algorithms endlessly, the energy cost and equipment degradation and breakdown will eventually cost more than the actual bitcoins are worth.\n\n**Pooled mining**, however, is far more lucrative. Using a service  you can split the work among a ground of people. Using this equation:\n\n> (12.5 BTC + block fees – 2% fee) * (shares found by user’s workers) / (total shares in current round)\n\nPutting it simply, it is basically how the system works. You work for shares in a block and when complete you get a percentage of the block reward based on the number of workers alongside you. More the people in pool, higher the chances of rewards.\n\n## Types of Blockchains in use\n\nAny blockchain can be classified into any one of these categories-\n\n### Public Blockchain\nThe most basic of all blockchain concepts. This is the blockchain everyone uses out there.\n\nThe most basic features of this bockchain are –\n\n> Anyone can run a BTC/LTC full node and start mining.  \n> Anyone can make transactions on the BTC/LTC chain.  \n> Anyone can review/audit the blockchain in a Blockchain explorer.\n\nExample: [Bitcoin](http://bitcoin.org/), [Litecoin](https://litecoin.org/) etc.\n\n### Private Blockchain\n\nPrivate blockchain as its name suggests is a private property of an individual or an organization. Unlike public blockchain, here there is actually someone in charge who looks after important things such as read/write or whom to selectively give access to read or vice versa. Here the consensus is achieved on the whims of the central authority who can give mining rights to anyone or not at all!\n\nExample: [Bankchain](https://www.multichain.com/)\n\n### Consortium Blockchain\n\nThis type of blockchain tries to remove the sole autonomy which gets vested in just one entity by using private blockchains.\n\nSo here you have multiple authorities instead of just one. Basically, you have a group of companies or representative individuals coming together and making decisions for the benefit of the whole network. Such groups are also called consortiums or a federation; ergo the name **consortium** or **federated blockchain**.\n\nFor example, let’s suppose you have a consortium of world’s top 20 financial institutes out of which you could decide that if a transaction or block is voted/verified by more than 15 institutions, only then does it get added to the blockchain.\n\nExample: [r3](https://www.r3.com/), [EWF](http://energyweb.org/)\n\nIn fact, the idea that cryptographic keys and shared ledgers can incentivize users to secure and formalize digital relationships has imaginations running wild. Everyone from governments to IT firms to banks is seeking to build this transaction layer.\n\nAuthentication and authorization, vital to digital transactions, are established as a result of the configuration of blockchain technology. The idea can be applied to any need for a trustworthy system of record.",

This is the blockchain everyone uses out there.\n\nThe most basic features of this bockchain are –\n\n> Anyone can run a BTC/LTC full node and start mining.  \n> Anyone can make transactions on the BTC/LTC chain.  \n> Anyone can review/audit the blockchain in a Blockchain explorer.\n\nExample: [Bitcoin](http://bitcoin.org/), [Litecoin](https://litecoin.org/) etc.\n\n### Private Blockchain\n\nPrivate blockchain as its name suggests is a private property of an individual or an organization. Unlike public blockchain, here there is actually someone in charge who looks after important things such as read/write or whom to selectively give access to read or vice versa. Here the consensus is achieved on the whims of the central authority who can give mining rights to anyone or not at all!\n\nExample: [Bankchain](https://www.multichain.com/)\n\n### Consortium Blockchain\n\nThis type of blockchain tries to remove the sole autonomy which gets vested in just one entity by using private blockchains.\n\nSo here you have multiple authorities instead of just one. Basically, you have a group of companies or representative individuals coming together and making decisions for the benefit of the whole network. Such groups are also called consortiums or a federation; ergo the name **consortium** or **federated blockchain**.\n\nFor example, let’s suppose you have a consortium of world’s top 20 financial institutes out of which you could decide that if a transaction or block is voted/verified by more than 15 institutions, only then does it get added to the blockchain.\n\nExample: [r3](https://www.r3.com/), [EWF](http://energyweb.org/)\n\nIn fact, the idea that cryptographic keys and shared ledgers can incentivize users to secure and formalize digital relationships has imaginations running wild. Everyone from governments to IT firms to banks is seeking to build this transaction layer.\n\nAuthentication and authorization, vital to digital transactions, are established as a result of the configuration of blockchain technology. The idea can be applied to any need for a trustworthy system of record.",

        "content": "---\ntitle: My Testimony about Blockchain - Part 1\nsubTitle: from Genesis block to blockchain and everything in between!\ncategory: \"tech\"\ncover: cover.jpg\n---\n\n> Blockchain is a vast, **global distributed ledger** or database running on millions of devices and open to anyone, where not just information but anything of **value** — money, but also titles, deeds, identities, even votes — can be moved, stored and managed securely and privately. Trust is established through mass collaboration and clever code rather than by powerful intermediaries like governments and banks.  \n–Wikinomics\n\nSo I’ve been reading all about blockchains (even those 12 point font research papers!). This is a rough gist of what I learnt:-\n\n## A distributed ledger\n\nWikipedia [explains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_ledger) thus –\n\n> “A distributed ledger is a consensus of replicated, shared, and synchronised digital data geographically spread across multiple sites, countries, or institutions. There is no central administrator or centralised data storage.”\n\nThis seems too much condensed. Let me break it down for you.\n\n- There is no central authority.\n- Every transaction here occurs in front of an array of guards that maintain order and make sure the transactions are completed in full by both parties.\n- These guards are just some computers that have volunteered to become a ‘node’. Only these nodes can validate the transactions of every user on a blockchain.\n\nBefore we go any further, I need to tell you what a transaction means in this context.\n\n\n> A transaction occurs when there is an exchange of data between any two parties. It need not be money only. It can be any data, you can even make a deal involving official papers of properties through some blockchain implementing platform!\n\nAnd if this sounds scary, don’t worry; no-one, not even those nodes (the ones which supervise the transactions) know what exactly you exchanged! Kudos to privacy! And that’s not even half of it! I’ll explain more later.\n![conventional central authority](explain1.jpg)\nConsider the conventional case of a bank (a conventional central authority).\n\n> NOTE : We are using ‘bank’ as an example just because it comprises a good amount of ‘transactions’. Always remember that these ‘transactions’ can be of data or goods too!\n\nSo here, in a bank, all the transactions occurring between accounts would be verified by a single, central authority, and all your possessions currently with the bank would be at the mercy of the whims of the bank, the **single point of security** in the transaction. If, by any chance, the bank burns down (physical damage to central authority) or gets robbed (or hacked), or seizes your account (unethically or otherwise) , there would be consequences, the likes of which you most probably won’t be comfortable with.\n\nEnter blockchain with the power of consensus based distributed ledger! If we consider the case of bitcoin blockchain, there are about 7000 nodes in the network that all work for the security of all those precious bitcoins that keep soaring and falling by the minute. For bitcoin to fail, all these 7000 points of security would have to be attacked at the same time, or at-least half of them. Not only that, with the sky-high pricing of these virtual currencies, more and more people are opting in to become nodes, which adds to security of the users(traders) making transactions over bitcoin blockchain. *So that’s security for you and the ‘things’ you love!* If you wish to know more about blockchain that deals with data, check out ethereum. Ethereum is an open-source, public, blockchain-based distributed computing platform and operating system featuring smart contract functionality.\n\n## **Block**\nA block is the ‘current’ part of a blockchain, which records some or all of the recent transactions. Once completed, a block goes into the blockchain as a permanent database. Each time a block gets completed, a new one is generated. There are countless such blocks in the blockchain, connected to each other (like links in a chain) in proper linear, chronological order. Every block contains a hash of the previous block. The blockchain has complete information about different user addresses and their balances right from the genesis block to the most recently completed block. Every node on the blockchain has a copy of the ledger with themselves, that gets synced after creation of a new block.\n## The ‘what’ block ?\nEvery blockchain has to start somewhere, so there’s what’s called a **genesis block** at the beginning. This is the first block, and there, at the beginning, the creators of Ethereum (or any other cryptocurrency) were at liberty to say “*To start, the following accounts all have X units of my cryptocurrency.*” Any transfer of data on the blockchain will have originated from one of these initial accounts (or from mining).\n\nThe blockchain was designed so these transactions are immutable, meaning they cannot be deleted. The blocks are added through cryptography (more, later), ensuring that they remain meddle-proof: The data can be distributed, but not copied (a node never knows exactly what’s in these transactions). You can always see a block yourself by using a Blockchain Explorer.\n\n## Privacy – how?\nThe blockchain isn’t just a bunch of computers watching that A sent something to B in return for some data; it’s so much more than that! On-chain transactions refer to those cryptocurrency transactions which occur on the blockchain – that is, on the records of the blockchain – and remain dependent on the state of the blockchain for their validity. All such on-chain transactions occur and are considered to be valid only when the blockchain is modified to reflect these transactions on the public ledger records.\n\n## What the crypto?!\nSo how does *cryptography* exactly fit in with this blockchain? It’s simple- the nodes lock the data with a  256 bit number (Hash Sum) that represents the data within a block. A different blockchain may use a different hash function, but the basic idea of its integration in the blockchain remains the same (more or less).\n\n### Hashing Functions\n![A basic idea of any hash function.](hash.png)\n<p align='center'> <a href=\"https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/File:Hash_function.svg\">source</a></p>\n\nIf you look closely, you’ll notice even a slight change (even just 1 bit) in the data would create a different hash sum altogether. ***There is simply no pattern at all!***\n\nSo here comes the answer to a question that might’ve struck you-\n\n> Why would anyone waste her/his own electricity and compute power to validate my transactions? Social service? Repentance out of guilt?\n\nIt’s MONEY!\n\nThere are nodes, there are traders, then there are MINERS.\n\nMiners are a subset of nodes as all miners must be running a full node (ie they must have complete ledger with themselves) in order to mine (at least to mine properly). The nodes are what determine consensus as **all nodes must agree to the same rules otherwise the nodes will fork off of the network.**\n\n<p align='center'>Continue Reading</p>\n",

The reason was implicit: to work with packages having latest features. My IRC friends at [#dgplug](https://brute4s99.gitlab.io/dgplug/) suggested me a few flavors to choose from- latest Ubuntu build, latest Fedora build, or a rolling release distribution.\n## What’s a Rolling Release?\n\nA rolling release is a type of [linux distribution model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_distribution) in which instead of releasing major updates to the entire operating system after a scheduled period of time, a rolling release operating system can be changed at the application level, whenever a change is pushed by [upstream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstream_(software_development)).\n\nThere are a couple of rolling release models – semi-rolling and full rolling – and the difference is in how and what packages are pushed out to users as they become available.\n\nA semi-rolling distribution, such as [Chakra Linux](https://www.chakralinux.org/) and [PCLinuxOS](https://www.pclinuxos.com/), classifies some packages to be upgraded through a fixed release system (usually the base operating system) in order to maintain stability.\n\nA full rolling release, such as Gentoo, Arch, OpenSUSE Tumbleweed, and Microsoft Windows 10, pushes out updates to the base operating system and other applications very frequently – sometimes as often as every few hours!\n## Why switch?\n\nThe main benefit to a rolling release model is the ability for the end user to use the newest features the developer has enabled. For example, one of the newer features of the Linux kernel, introduced with the 4.0 update, was the ability to update the kernel without restarting your computer. In a rolling release distribution, as soon as this update was tested and marked as working by the development team, it could then be pushed out to the user of the distribution, enabling all future updates to the kernel to occur without computer restarts.\n## What’s new?\n\nFor ubuntu users, it’s the same thing as if you come to Linux from Windows; there is a learning curve.\n\nAn excerpt from the [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_Linux#Principles) states thus:-\n\n> Arch Linux is a general-purpose distribution. Upon installation, only a command-line environment is provided: rather than tearing out unneeded and unwanted packages, the user is offered the ability to build a custom system by choosing among thousands of high-quality packages provided in the [official repositories](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Official_repositories) for the [x86-64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/x86-64) architecture.\n\nOh, and one more thing- none of the proprietary softwares/packages/drivers come with the base installation. [Read more about them here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software).\n\nIf you still think you can steer clear off the proprietary softwares , [think again](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=87170), and [one more time](https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/56zcuf/what_proprietary_commercial_software_do_you_use/).\n\nTheory’s over.\n## Baby Steps\n\nA few pointers before we start the installation:-\n\n1. The installation requires a working internet connection. So, I had a wired ethernet connection ready at my disposal.  A WiFi module that’s NOT with a Broadcomm Chipset would be just as fine. Since I have the Broadcomm Chipset, I switched to wired connection for the time being.\n2. Once I’ll get the installation done, all I’ll have is a bare-bones installation with a log-in shell. You must absolutely be comfortable with the terminal, as almost no graphical utility comes out of the box.\n\nI grabbed a USB and prepped it with this [Arch Linux img](https://www.archlinux.org/download/). First thing after booting from the USB – I connected to the internet.\n\n> In case you have **Broadcomm chipset in your WiFi**, follow [this](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Broadcom_wireless). You need the driver firmware for the Broadcomm chipset to get it working on your laptop, since it’s proprietary.\n\n## Connecting to the Internet\n### Connecting to internet via Ethernet\n\nJust Plug n Play, you’re good to go!\n### Connecting to internet via WiFi\n\n1.Create a profile for your wifi in there\n\n`# wifi-menu`\n\n2.Connect to the profile you set by\n\n`# netctl start <profile_name>`\n\n3.If you want to enable it to connect automatically at startup\n\n`# netctl enable <profile_name>`\n### Connecting to internet via Android USB tethering\n\n1.List all your DHCP interfaces that are now available\n\n`$ ls /sys/class/net`\n\n2.Connect to the new inteface provided by Arch for your USB tethered device!\n\n`# dhcpcd <enp....something_profile_name>`\n\nCheck if you’re online :    `$ ping -c3 google.com`\n____________________________________________________\nThere are many good tutorials out there, [follow any one of these](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=install+arch+linux+uefi).\n\nNow that Arch was installed, I booted up the system and got connected to the internet again.\n\n![image](tty.png)\n\nNow that I was online, I set up a GUI !\n## Installing a GUI\n\nSo the first thing I decided to get for the Arch was GUI! It’s a quite simple procedure, you need a display manager, and a Desktop Environment to interact to the X server.\n\n> ## X Server\n> X is an application that manages one or more graphics displays and one or more input devices (keyboard, mouse, etc.) connected to the computer.  \n> It works as a server and can run on the local computer or on another computer on the network. Services can communicate with the X server to display graphical interfaces and receive input from the user.\n\nMy choice:  `# pacman -S sddm plasma`\n\n#### IMPO ! Install a terminal before rebooting to GUI !\n\n`# pacman -S konsole`\n## Configuring terminal\n\nSources + References:-\n\n1. http://jilles.me/badassify-your-terminal-and-shell/\n\n### Configuring weechat\n\nSources + References:-\n\n1. https://alexjj.com/blog/2016/9/setting-up-weechat/\n2. https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/WeeChat\n\nSurfing through some sites also got me through a good command that would be of much help to most!\n\n`/mouse enable`  # In case you’d like to use the mouse in weechat\n\n`/redraw`          # A saviour for guys SSH-ing to any [ZNC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZNC)\n## You can’t find the packages through pacman?\n\nEnter AUR : the [Arch User Repository](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_User_Repository)\n\nSuppose I have to get a package that cannot be found by pacman. I will try to find it at [AUR home page](https://aur.archlinux.org/).\n\nfor eg : [ngrok](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ngrok/). Now, after reading description, I know this is the package I was looking for. So, now I will see how I can acquire the package.\n\nHere I can see two ways to acquire the package- by git clone (preferred), or by downloading the **tarball**.\n\nIt gives me one file : PKGBUILD . These **PKGBUILD**s can be built into installable packages using makepkg , then installed using pacman .\n\n> ## Fakeroot\n> Imagine that you are a developer/package maintainer, etc. working on a remote server. You want to update the contents of a package and rebuild it, download and customize a kernel from kernel.org and build it, etc. While trying to do those things, you’ll find out that some steps require you to have **root** rights (**UID** and **GID** 0) for different reasons (security, overlooked permissions, etc). But it is not possible to get **root** rights, since you are working on a remote machine (and many other users have the same problem as you). This is what exactly **fakeroot** does: it pretends an effective **UID** and **GID** of 0 to the environment which requires them.  \nP.S:-\n> -    UID: User ID\n> -    GID: Group ID\n\nThe git clone method is preferred since you can then update the package by simply git pull.\n## Why so much fuss ?\n\nYou can always try out [AUR helpers](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/AUR_helpers). I set up [yay](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/yay/) in my configuration, since it also shows DIFFs when installing new/upgrading packages through AURs.\n\n> ## Why would you want to read DIFFs?\n> Essentially, it’s a shell script,(so it can possibly have mailicious / dangerous content, so look before you leap) but since it’s ran as fakeroot, there is some level of security albeit. Still, we shouldn’t try and push our luck.\n\nSo after all this, I successfully set up Arch Linux, WiFi, Desktop Environment, Terminal and Weechat in my laptop! Next was installing basic software packages and fine tuning the GUI to my personal tastes.\n\nFirefox Developer Edition – For Web Browsing\n\ntor-browser – For private internet access\n\nKonsole – Terminal\n\nDeepin Music Player – Music Player\n\nGwenview – Image viewer and editing solution\n\nSteam – for Games\n\nKontact – for updates on calendar events\n\nVLC – Video player\nThe end result\n\n![image](final.png)\n\n<p align='center'> beautiful, isn’t it?</p>\n\nSetting up a personal Arch Linux machine taught me many things about the core Linux system, how exactly the system is set up during installation and how different utilities orchestrate to form my complete workstation ready to build beautiful code and software!",

It’s a quite simple procedure, you need a display manager, and a Desktop Environment to interact to the X server.\n\n> ## X Server\n> X is an application that manages one or more graphics displays and one or more input devices (keyboard, mouse, etc.) connected to the computer.  \n> It works as a server and can run on the local computer or on another computer on the network. Services can communicate with the X server to display graphical interfaces and receive input from the user.\n\nMy choice:  `# pacman -S sddm plasma`\n\n#### IMPO ! Install a terminal before rebooting to GUI !\n\n`# pacman -S konsole`\n## Configuring terminal\n\nSources + References:-\n\n1. http://jilles.me/badassify-your-terminal-and-shell/\n\n### Configuring weechat\n\nSources + References:-\n\n1. https://alexjj.com/blog/2016/9/setting-up-weechat/\n2. https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/WeeChat\n\nSurfing through some sites also got me through a good command that would be of much help to most!\n\n`/mouse enable`  # In case you’d like to use the mouse in weechat\n\n`/redraw`          # A saviour for guys SSH-ing to any [ZNC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZNC)\n## You can’t find the packages through pacman?\n\nEnter AUR : the [Arch User Repository](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_User_Repository)\n\nSuppose I have to get a package that cannot be found by pacman. I will try to find it at [AUR home page](https://aur.archlinux.org/).\n\nfor eg : [ngrok](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ngrok/). Now, after reading description, I know this is the package I was looking for. So, now I will see how I can acquire the package.\n\nHere I can see two ways to acquire the package- by git clone (preferred), or by downloading the **tarball**.\n\nIt gives me one file : PKGBUILD . These **PKGBUILD**s can be built into installable packages using makepkg , then installed using pacman .\n\n> ## Fakeroot\n> Imagine that you are a developer/package maintainer, etc. working on a remote server. You want to update the contents of a package and rebuild it, download and customize a kernel from kernel.org and build it, etc. While trying to do those things, you’ll find out that some steps require you to have **root** rights (**UID** and **GID** 0) for different reasons (security, overlooked permissions, etc). But it is not possible to get **root** rights, since you are working on a remote machine (and many other users have the same problem as you). This is what exactly **fakeroot** does: it pretends an effective **UID** and **GID** of 0 to the environment which requires them.  \nP.S:-\n> -    UID: User ID\n> -    GID: Group ID\n\nThe git clone method is preferred since you can then update the package by simply git pull.\n## Why so much fuss ?\n\nYou can always try out [AUR helpers](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/AUR_helpers). I set up [yay](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/yay/) in my configuration, since it also shows DIFFs when installing new/upgrading packages through AURs.\n\n> ## Why would you want to read DIFFs?\n> Essentially, it’s a shell script,(so it can possibly have mailicious / dangerous content, so look before you leap) but since it’s ran as fakeroot, there is some level of security albeit. Still, we shouldn’t try and push our luck.\n\nSo after all this, I successfully set up Arch Linux, WiFi, Desktop Environment, Terminal and Weechat in my laptop! Next was installing basic software packages and fine tuning the GUI to my personal tastes.\n\nFirefox Developer Edition – For Web Browsing\n\ntor-browser – For private internet access\n\nKonsole – Terminal\n\nDeepin Music Player – Music Player\n\nGwenview – Image viewer and editing solution\n\nSteam – for Games\n\nKontact – for updates on calendar events\n\nVLC – Video player\nThe end result\n\n![image](final.png)\n\n<p align='center'> beautiful, isn’t it?</p>\n\nSetting up a personal Arch Linux machine taught me many things about the core Linux system, how exactly the system is set up during installation and how different utilities orchestrate to form my complete workstation ready to build beautiful code and software!",

Some websites will have well over 60 trackers, belonging to a multitude of companies, while others might have only one - perhaps to track visitor numbers, or see where these visitors are coming from, or to enable a certain functionality. Some might have none at all. \n\nNot all trackers are necessarily tied to companies tracking your browsing habits - but when you **accept cookies**, you're saying `ok` to *all* the trackers that are there - including those feeding info back to companies.\n\n\n## What is being collected and Why?\n\nTrackers collect information about which websites you're visiting, as well as information about your devices.\n\nOne tracker might be there to give the website owner insight into her website traffic, but the rest belong to **companies whose primary goal is to build up a profile of who you are**: how old you are, where you live, what you read, and what you're interested in. \nThis information can then be packaged and sold to others: advertisers, other companies, or governments.\n\nThey are also joined by more well-known companies. Some of these are even visible: Google's red G+ button, for example, is a tracker;  Facebook's \"like\" thumb is a tracker; and Twitter's little blue bird is also a tracker.\n\n\n## Why does it affect me?\n\nData companies and advertisers also know which articles you read and which ones you skip, which videos you watch, and which ones you stop after 5 seconds; which promotional emails you read, and which ones you send to your Trash folder without opening; what you like on Facebook, what you retweet, what you heart on Instagram. \n\nWhen you put all these things together, you end up with your own unique online fingerprint — which immediately identifies you, with all your likes and dislikes and personal traits\n\nAnd that’s potentially very bad news, because once they know exactly who you are and what makes you tick, companies and advertisers can:\n\n- **spam you with finely-tuned, targeted ad campaigns** that follow you around the web.\n- potentially **jack up their prices for you**. \n- **invade your privacy** and chip away at your anonymity online, which nobody likes. \n\n\n<p align='center'><img src=\"web_trackers.jpg\" alt=\"Web Trackers\"> <font size=2> An illustration from a <a href=\"https://medium.freecodecamp.org/what-you-should-know-about-web-tracking-and-how-it-affects-your-online-privacy-42935355525\">post</a> by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/princi_ya\">Princiya</a><br>She writes on awesome topics at FreeCodeCamp, you should check out here posts!</font>\n</p>\n\n\n## Tracking mechanisms\n\n### Cookies\nCookies are the most widely known method to identify a user. They use **small pieces of data (each limited to 4 KB) placed in a browser storage by the web server**. When a user visits a website for the first time, a cookie file with a unique user identifier (could be randomly generated) is stored on the user’s computer.\n\nSubsequent visits to the Facebook page do not require you to login, because your details will be remembered by the browser through a cookie stored during your first login.\n\n### Browser fingerprinting\nBrowser fingerprinting is a highly accurate way to identify and track users whenever they go online. The information collected is quite comprehensive, and often includes the browser type and version, operating system and version, screen resolution, supported fonts, plugins, time zone, language and font preferences, and even hardware configurations.\n\nThese identifiers may seem generic and not at all personally identifying. But, **typically only one in several million people have exactly the same specifications as you**.\n\n### Web beacons\n**Web beacons are very small, usually invisible objects embedded into a web page or email.** Web beacons are also referred to as “web bugs,” which also go by the names “tags,” “page tags,” “tracking bugs,” “pixel trackers,” or “pixel gifs.”\n\nIn their simplest form, they are tiny clear images, often the size of a single pixel. **They download as an image when the web page is loaded, or the email is opened, making a call to a remote server for the image.** The server call alerts the company that their email has just been opened or their web page visited.\nThis is why you should not display images in emails from senders you do not trust.\n\nWeb beacons are also used by online advertisers who embed them into their ads so they can independently track how often their ads are being displayed.\n\n## The Anonymization Myth\n\nMost companies claim that they don't identify you by name when they hand over a profile of you - but what does that really mean, when **you can be identified easily through all the other information included**?\n\nHere's a [good read on anonymization](https://tdwi.org/articles/2018/09/04/dwt-all-anonymization-myth.aspx).\n\n\n## Protecting your-**self**\n\nWhile companies (sometimes) allow users to take away their data off the company servers (for eg: [Google TakeOut](https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/help/1701730696756992/)), one can never be sure if that is the real deal or not. Companies might be still be retaining derivatives or seemingly \"anonymous\" attributes from user data. As such, it's always a better move to restrain giving away information as much as possible. Some ways are discussed below.\n\n\n\n1. Use browser add-ons.\n    >Many add-ons like [Privacy Badger](https://www.eff.org/privacybadger) from [EFF](https://www.eff.org) allow for users to take a look at all the third party trackers enabled by the website's owner, and disable them.\n\n2. Use [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/) or a VPN.\n\n    > If you connect to the Tor anonymizing system, or use Tor's browser, your ISP will only know that you have connected to Tor; from there it loses the data trail. Of course the downside to this is that your browsing will be slower.\n    >\n    > Be aware, your unencrypted traffic to websites outside the Tor network passes through a complete stranger's exit node: the person running the exit node can watch what you're doing. All you've done is move from your ISP snooping on you to an exit node admin watching you. On the other hand, you'll cycle through different exit nodes, so it's harder to be identified and tracked by websites outside the Tor network.\n\n    >A virtual private network is an alternative that will work for lots of people, especially if your work has a VPN service that you can use for free. This again will cut off your ISP's ability to see what you are doing.\n    >\n    >**But** do some research on your VPN provider. Do NOT use a free VPN provider because they face even stronger financial temptations to sell your information. If you use a VPN, you are effectively giving that company the same level of insight into your online life as your ISP. So pay for one, and check out their policies on what they do with the data they build on you.\n\n3. Use a different search engine.\n    > Google offers a wonderful service, but everything you type in its search box is logged and connected to you in as many ways as possible. It is then sold on.\n    >\n    >So why not use a different search engine? [DuckDuckGo](https://duck.co/help/desktop/adding-duckduckgo-to-your-browser) is an awesome search engine with NO user data logging.This Qoura answer tells more about [features of DuckDuckGo](https://duck.co/help/company/advertising-and-affiliates).\n\n    \n## Getting rid of some trackers from your site\n\n1. `ajax.cloudflare.com` \n\n    >inherent on website's hosted by Cloudflare's DNS.\n\n2. `graph.facebook.com`\n    \n    >active when Facebook's developer services (for eg: FB Comments plugin) are loading on a webpage.\n\n3. `clients6.google.com`\n    \n    >active when webpages directly call Google servers for Javascript codes.\n\n4. `fonts.gstatic.com`\n    \n    >active when Google fonts are called for CSS scripts.\n\n5. `www.linkedin.com`\n\n    >active when there are links to linkedin in the webpage.\n\n\n## Tracking the trackers\n![image](lightbeam.png)\n\n Lightbeam from [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/) is privacy browser extension helps you discover who’s tracking you online while you browse the web. \n \n You can get it [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/lightbeam/).\n\n## Some links\n\n- [Facebook's data exchange](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/12/facebooks-failures-and-also-its-problems-leaking-data/578599/)\n\n- [The WebTAP Project](randomwalker.info/publications/webtap-chapter.pdf)\n- [Third-party tracking on the web](www.franziroesner.com/pdf/webtracking-NSDI2012.pdf)\n- [Mozilla Privacy Basics](https://learning.mozilla.org/en-US/activities/privacy-basics/)\n<p align='center'> <font size=3> Stay safe and make the internet a healthier place! </font></p>\n",

Remove existing `pandas` installation\n    ```\n    pip uninstall pandas\n    ```\n### 1. Fork [me](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas)!\n### 2. Clone the fork to your PC.\n### 3. Install `pandas` from source.\n\n- `cd` into the clone and install the build dependencies.\n    ```\n    python -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt\n    ```\n\n- Build and install pandas. (takes ~20 minutes on an i5 6200U with 8GB RAM)\n    ```\n    python setup.py build_ext --inplace -j 4 \n    python -m pip install -e .\n    ```\n\n## Background\n\nWork on `pandas` started at AQR (a quantitative hedge fund) in 2008 and has been under active development since then.\n\n### [Chat with more pandas at Gitter.im!](https://gitter.im/pydata/pandas)\n\n## Some Tips\n\n- [Documentation for reference purposes.](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/)\n\n- rebase using `git rebase upstream/master` to pull in the latest from the upstream `remote` (which you have set to http://github.com/pydata/pandas.git)\n\n\n## Bad Trips\n\nI accidentally rebased on `origin/master`. That was **~350 commits behind `upstream/master`** !\n\n### Steps taken:-\n>\n>  - reverted `HEAD` to just before rebase\n>   - merged `upstream/master` into `origin/is_scalar`\n>   - updated `origin/master` to get NO diffs in `upstream/master` and `origin/master`\n>    - ran git rebase origin/master and fixed a conflict in `doc/source/whatsnew/v0.24.0.rst`\n>    - pushed to `origin/is_scalar`.\n\n\n\n\n\n<p align='center'> <font size=3> Stay safe and make the internet a healthier place! </font></p>\n",
